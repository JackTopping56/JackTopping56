👋 Hi there, I'm Jack Topping, a passionate 3rd Year Computer Science student and aspiring software engineer. I also enjoy tutoring Mathematics & Computer Science to 11-16 year olds.

👀 My main interest lies in the exciting field of blockchain and smart contract development. I'm fascinated by the potential of decentralized systems and their impact on various industries.

🌱 Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in Solidity and JavaScript/TypeScript, combining them with React to build robust applications. Additionally, I'm gaining proficiency in deploying applications on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) platform.
